Ideally the user should provide the name of the account, the target number of hours per week for the assignment, the duration of the assignment, optionally the timezone of the account.

Output:
"Here's my recommendation for the top candidates for the new assignment, ranked by suitability:

**Top Candidates:**

1.  **Abhilash Thumma:**
    *   **Justification:** Abhilash has experience working with Motorola Solutions, which is a significant advantage. His workload for the week ending Aug 16, is projected to be 26 hours. He is also timezone compatible.

2.  **Valavan Rajakumar:**
    *   **Justification:** Valavan has the lightest workload for the week ending Aug 16, 2025, at 16 hours. Valavan is timezone compatible but lacks prior experience with the account.

3.  **Kyle Romell:**
    *   **Justification:** Kyle has a manageable workload for the week ending Aug 16 and Aug 23, 2025, at 34 and 28 hours respectively, and he's in a compatible timezone. While he doesn't have prior experience with Motorola Solutions, his availability makes him a good option.

4.  **Laurence Chiu:**
    *   **Justification:** Laurence has the second lightest workload for the week ending Aug 16, 2025, at 20 hours, but he becomes busy on Aug 23 with 48h. He is also timezone compatible, but lacks prior experience with the account.
